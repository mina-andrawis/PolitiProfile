A platform where users will be introduced to politicians and candidates who represent their ideals. This information will give voters an enhanced ability to support the individuals making the biggest waves in their niche. Personally, I would love the ability to find elected officials who always seem to be proposing bills that I agree with. I want to find the people fighting the good fight.

Often times, the word Politician is a dirty word. It feels like they do not have our best interest at heart.. but it doesn’t have to be that way. There are those politicians who (more or less) deserve recognition. Whether it be continually proposing bills that you feel are really important or making the important and difficult votes that we expect from our representatives. Even if a member of congress does not directly represent your state, they still affect you. They play a vital hand in passing federal laws, which range from taxes to abortion to legalizing weed. Whatever topic you are interested in, there is a congress member or candidate who espouses the same ideals.

You will be informed on who is running against your representatives come election season, and insights into how they feel about the things you care about! This will also act as a resource to quickly compare the positions of candidates for your local, state, and federal elections with a simple UI.

AI will be used to analyze bills and make them readable to the average person, increasing transparency and lowering the barrier of entry to be an informed citizen.

Personally, I’ve discovered politicians who don’t even represent my state and have continued to follow and support them. I’d love to have this phenomenon become more mainstream so we can elevate the politicians who deserve our attention and discourage the many sleezy ones.

There will be a questionnaire to the user asking what topics they are interested in. Then they are matched to politicians who align with their views.
